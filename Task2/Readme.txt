Phishing Email Analysis - Task 2 (Cyber Security Internship)

##Sample Used:

From: 	 support@office-365-notifications[.]com  
To:	 john[.]doe@mybusiness[.]com  
Subject: Microsoft account security alert  


##The email claims that:
- Someone accessed your Microsoft account
- You need to verify your identity and change your password
- A button labeled **"Recover account"** is provided
- The sender signs off as **The Microsoft account team**


 Indicator 				| Description |

| Spoofed Sender Address 		| The domain `office-365-notifications[.]com` is not a genuine Microsoft domain |
| Urgency & Fear Tactic 		| Suggests unauthorized access to your account to create panic and drive action |
| Suspicious Button 			| “Recover account” likely leads to a **fake login page** designed to steal credentials |
| Impersonation of a Trusted Brand 	| Uses Microsoft branding and layout to appear legitimate |
| No Personalization	 		| Doesn’t address the user by full name or provide custom recovery details |
| Generic Sign-off 			| Vague ending with “The Microsoft account team” instead of specific support contact |
| Poor Domain Structure 		| Official Microsoft security alerts would come from domains like `@microsoft.com`, not `@office-365-notifications[.]com`
