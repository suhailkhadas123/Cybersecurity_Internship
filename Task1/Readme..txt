#  Network Port Scanning with Nmap + Wireshark


##  Date: [26-05-2025]

---

##  Objective
Perform a TCP SYN scan on the local network using **Nmap**, and capture the traffic using **Wireshark** to understand how port scanning works at the packet level.

---

##  Tools Used

- **Nmap** â€“ Port scanning
- **Wireshark** â€“ Packet capture & analysis
- **OS:** Windows

---

##  Procedure

### 1. Identified Local IP Range
Using `ipconfig` 
```
IP Range: 192.168.1.0/24
```

### 2. Started Wireshark Capture
- Interface: Active network (Wi-Fi/Ethernet)
- Applied filter after scan:
  ```
  ip.addr == 192.168.1.4 and tcp.flags.syn == 1

  ```

### 3. Ran Nmap SYN Scan
```bash
nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
```

### 4. Stopped and Saved Wireshark Capture
- File saved as `nmap_scan_capture.pcapng`
